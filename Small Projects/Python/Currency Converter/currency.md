### Currency Converter Module

The provided code is a simple currency converter module that utilizes the `forex-python` library to get exchange rates and convert currency from one unit to another. The functionality is encapsulated within a class named `Main`, and the main method for conversion is `convert`.

#### Class: `Main`

##### Method: `convert(inCurr, outCurr, values: float = None)`

```python
@classmethod
def convert(cls, inCurr, outCurr, values: float = None):
    """
    Convert currency from one unit to another.

    Parameters:
        in_curr (str): The currency code of the input currency.
        out_curr (str): The currency code of the desired output currency.
        values (float, optional): The amount to be converted. If not provided, the user will be prompted to enter it.

    Returns:
        str: A formatted string representing the converted currency value.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If either input or output currency codes are empty.
        ValueError: If the exchange rates are not available for the specified currencies.

    Example:
        To convert 100 USD to EUR:
        >>> CurrencyConverter.convert('USD', 'EUR', 100)
        '100.0 USD is 87.0 EUR'
    """
```

This method allows the user to convert a given amount from one currency to another. It takes in the input currency code (`inCurr`), output currency code (`outCurr`), and an optional `values` parameter representing the amount to be converted. If `values` is not provided, the user will be prompted to enter it.

The method uses the `forex-python` library to fetch exchange rates and perform the conversion. It returns a formatted string representing the converted currency value.

#### Example Usage

```python
# Example Usage
result = Main.convert('USD', 'EUR', 100)
print(result)
# Output: '100.0 USD is 87.0 EUR'
```

### Considerations

1. **Input Validation**: The method currently checks if either input or output currency codes are empty and raises a `ValueError`. However, further input validation can be added to ensure that the provided currency codes are valid.

2. **Error Handling**: The method catches `CurrencyRates.RatesNotAvailableError` and prints an error message. It might be beneficial to allow the calling code to handle this exception and decide how to proceed.

3. **User Interaction**: The method prompts the user to enter the amount if it's not provided. Depending on the use case, it might be useful to handle this interaction differently or allow the calling code to manage it.

4. **Rounding**: The result is currently rounded to two decimal places. Depending on the application, it might be useful to allow the calling code to specify the precision or rounding strategy.
